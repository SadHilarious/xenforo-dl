# xenforo-dl

A smal fork of [patrickkfkan/xenforo-dl](https://github.com/patrickkfkan/xenforo-dl) as [XenForo](https://xenforo.com/) forum downloader written in [Node.js](https://nodejs.org):

- Scrapes content from forum pages
- For each thread, downloads attachments and saves messages in text files
- Supports downloading a single thread or all threads in a forum
- Supports continuing from previous download

Since the downloader works through scraping, it is not guaranteed to work with all XenForo forums. I created the downloader for my data-hoarding needs targeting a handful of sites, so it might be limited in what it can scrape. But feel free to raise issues.


## Installation

First, install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).

Then, clone this repo and install dependencies:

```
npm install
```

And build these tsx files:
```
npm run build
```

## Usage

```
node ./bin/xenforo-dl.js [OPTION]... URL
```
or link it globally:
```
npm link && xenforo-dl
```
### URL

#### Thread URLs

Pattern: `<forum_site_url>/threads/<title_slug>.<thread_id>[/page-<num>]`

Download all messages and attachments shown on page. If content spans multiple pages, download from subsequent pages as well.

If `page-<num>` is present in URL, then download will begin with the specified page.

#### Forum URLs

Pattern: `<forum_site_url>/forums/<title_slug>.<forum_id>[/page-<num>]`

Download all threads listed on page. If the forum has threads spanning multiple pages, download from subsequent pages as well.

If `page-<num>` is present in URL, then download will begin with the specified page.

#### Other URLs

For URLs not matching the above patterns, `xenforo-dl` will scrape for forum links and download from them. It is your responsibility to ensure the given URL is a valid XenForo link.
